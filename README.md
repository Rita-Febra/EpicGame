**Epic Game**



**Project Description**

First bootcamp group project at <Academia de Código_> after 3 weeks of learning Java. We were challenged to develop a game applying the technologies we had learned with a deadline of 10 nights, as the classes proceeded during daytime.

**The Idea**

Project inspired on Looney Tunes.
This game tests your reaction time and cognitive abilities. 
It´s a two player game (Taz and Coyote) , fighting for food.But be careful ! There will be some nasty food.

**Development**

We worked together when building the basic functionality of the game, once we reached the minimum viable product we divided the work into extra features in pairs of two and tree.
We used the Simple Graphics library for the development of the graphical interface. 

**Paradigm**

OOP

**Technologies**

Java 8, SimpleGFX Library, IntelliJ IDEA, Apache Ant, Git,Photopea .
